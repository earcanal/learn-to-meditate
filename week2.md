## Week 2

In [Week 1](week1.md) you learnt how to prepare you mind and posture for meditation, and the three stages of Ajahn Brahm's
method of meditation.  The goal this week is to meditate daily for 15 minutes.

Use [the guided meditation]((https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8G4U8ekxz_TTFYxenhVLXpPTzg/view?usp=sharing)) for at least
the first 3 days this week.  Find your relaxed, alert posture as you listen to Ajahn Brahm's brief introduction.
He will then guide you through stage 1 (sustained attention on the present moment) and stage 2 (silent awareness of the present moment).
I've added some breath counting instruction which should help with stage 3 (silent present moment awareness of the breath).  Once you
become comfortable with this routine, you could try it without the guidance if you prefer.

Here's a reminder of the brief, but powerful breath exercise we did in the class.

_Sit in any posture that allows you to be alert and relaxed at the same time,
whatever that means to you. You may keep your eyes open or closed. Let us take three breaths. In the first breath,
bring gentle but intense attention to the process of breathing. In the second breath, calm the body. In the third breath,
bring up joy. If necessary, bring up a smile or a half smile, whatever the words half smile mean to you. If any joy arises,
bring full attention to it. If you like, repeat this three-breaths practice a few more times._

-- Chade Meng Tan, [Joy on Demand](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=9huoCgAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&dq=joy%20on%20demand&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q=joy%20on%20demand&f=false)

This is a fast (3 breaths take between 15-30 seconds), powerful exercise which you can use to start your meditation, and also
when you first move your attention to the breath.  It resets your posture, tunes your awareness to the in-breath and out-breath,
and orients you towards feelings of joy.  This feeling of joy can become intrinsically motivating, making your daily meditation
a pleasurable experience that you enjoy, and look forward to.
