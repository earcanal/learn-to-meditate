## Week 4

Use the guided meditation above for at least the first one or two 25 minute meditations.  You can complete the remaining meditations for the week guided or unguided.  Surprisingly, many people seem to manage to do these slightly longer meditations more frequently than on the shorter ones in previous weeks.  This could be the "payday effect" that Ajahn Brahm describes in the document above; a result of all of the hard work you've put in so far.  

Of course, all of your good and bad meditations are now in the past!  So treat this week as a brand new opportunity to get a taste for what meditation has to offer, and give it everything you've got!
