Read pages 1-5 which are the official instructions for the course.

## Week 4

Use the guided meditation above for at least the first one or two 25 minute meditations.  You can complete the remaining meditations for the week guided or unguided.  Surprisingly, many people seem to manage to do these slightly longer meditations more frequently than on the shorter ones in previous weeks.  This could be the "payday effect" that Ajahn Brahm describes in the document above; a result of all of the hard work you've put in so far.  

Of course, all of your good and bad meditations are now in the past!  So treat this week as a brand new opportunity to get a taste for what meditation has to offer, and give it everything you've got!

## Kindfulness

Ajahn Brahm emphasises "kindfulness" in the meditations which we have been doing.  Here is some very practical advice which you can apply before and during meditation, which will be of particular interest to psychologists:
