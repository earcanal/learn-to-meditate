# Week 1

Great to see you today.

I've attached Ajahn Brahm's Basic Method of Meditation, the official instruction manual for the type of meditation we're doing.  Have a read up to page 5 which is as far as we'll be going in this course.  This will reinforce the introduction I gave you at the session.

Here's a link to the 10 minute guided meditation I'd like you to download and use this week:

You don't need to keep track of time, as the instruction will tell you when to end the meditation.  Feel free to meditate a bit longer if you like.  I suggest you use this guided meditation for at least the first 2 or 3 sessions.  If you prefer to meditate without the guidance, you can time the meditation using a phone, or an ordinary clock or watch (open your eyes briefly to check the time but remember Ajahn Brahm's advice regarding clock watching).

Bring any questions you have to the session next week.  This way we get to share
solutions to common meditation obstacles.  However, don't hesitate to
get in touch if you need help before then.
