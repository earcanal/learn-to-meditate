## Week 1

This week's meditation will reinforce the the 3 meditation stages which were introduced in the first class.  You don't need to keep track of time, as the instruction will tell you when to end the meditation.  Feel free to meditate a bit longer if you like.  Use this guided meditation for at least the first 2 or 3 sessions.

### Day 1: Establishing a meditation practice

Recall [the post-it note exercise](https://goo.gl/qqrM5V) we did in the class.

Your goal this week is establish a daily practice routine in which you prepare for meditation (step 0), and become familiar with the 3 stages.  To establish this routine, briefly review your meditation goals and motivations each day.  When you meditate, try to let go of expectations.  Become interested in, rather than frustrated by distractions, and practise diligently!

If you're struggling to meditate daily, try to discover and stick to your optimum meditation time and place.  To overcome procrastination, do your meditation before any competing tasks.  You may find the meditation makes those tasks easier or more enjoyable.  Use any inspiration, motivation and pleasure associated with meditation to counter reluctance and resistance to actually doing the practice.  You all know how to meditate, so trust in your abilities!

### Day 2: Posture

Meditation posture should generally be  **comfortable and upright** or **simultaneously relaxed and alert**.  If you're sitting in a chair, choose one similar to those we had in the session.  Sit with feet flat on the floor, head balanced on top (to avoid nodding).  Follow the same principles sitting on the floor if you prefer.  It's fine to use cushions or to sit against a wall to support your back.  Starting by getting as comfortable as possible will minimise any disturbances from having to move during the meditation.  The upgrightness should prevent you from falling asleep.  It's fine to make adjustments to re-establish comfort or upgrightness during the meditation.  However, do this slowly, and incorporate it into the meditation by noticing the body sensations as you make any adjustments.

Here's Ajahn Brahm talking about meditation posture:

### Day 3: Preparation, Sustained attention on the present moment

Here's Ajahn Brahm explaining how you prepare for meditation (stage 0), then how letting go of the past and the future reveals the present moment (stage 1):

### Day 4: Silent awareness of the present moment

Recall Ajahn Brahm's simile for stage 2:

*You may imagine your mind to be a host at a party, meeting the guests as they come in the door. If one guest comes in and you meet them and start talking to them about this that or the other, then you are not doing your duty of paying
attention to the next guest that comes in the door.  Since a guest comes in the door every moment, all you can do is to
greet one and then immediately go on to greet the next one.  You cannot afford to engage in even the shortest conversation with any guest, since this would mean you would miss the one coming in next. In meditation, all experiences come through the door of our senses into the mind one by one in succession. If you greet one experience with mindfulness and then get into conversation with your guest, then you will miss the next experience following right behind.*
