There's a lot more space on this meditation.  Follow Ajahn Brahm's guidance, then use the feedback from what you're experiencing to judge when to move between the 3 stages.  When moving to the breath, start by doing at least 5 cycles of breath counting.  If you're not losing count, you can try following the breath without counting.

Sleepiness is a common challenge for meditators.  If you're falling asleep it's a sign that your posture is relaxed (good), but not quite alert enough.  You can counter this, and make it part of the meditation, by straightening your spine each time you notice yourself "sinking".  Think of it as the physical counterpart of noticing your mind wandering, and bringing it back to the breath.
